**Introduce**

This project is used to create monthly invoices automatically. It can help you save a lot of time when you do dull and repetitive works.

I wrote the program in both Javascript (which is used on Google Sheet) and VBA (which is used on Excel).
The sample data is also uploaded, so you can try it on your own.


**How to run the program**

With Excel, you need to download 'Invoice Template' file, then click the buttons on 'INV list' sheet to see how the program runs. 

With Google Sheet, you need to access the link below, then notice the buttons 'Invoice' on the taskbar and click buttons under it to run the program.
